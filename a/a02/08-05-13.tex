Let 
\begin{align*}
U &= \{1, 2, 3, ..., 100\} \\
A &= \{x \in U \mid x \text{ is odd}\} \\
B &= \{x \in U \mid x \text{ is square}\} \\
\end{align*}
The required number is $|A \cup B|$.
The principle of inclusion-exclusion states
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cup B|
\]

The number of integers in $U$ which are even is 
$\floor{\frac{100}{2}} = 50$.
Therefore 
\[
|A| = |U| - 50 = 50
\]
The squares in $B$ are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2, 10^2$.
Therefore $|B| = 10$.
(In general, the number of squares in 1, 2, 3, ..., $n$ is
$\floor{\sqrt{n}}$.)
Furthmoremore, the integers in 
$1^2$, $2^2$, $3^3$, $4^2$, $5^2$, $6^2$, $7^2$, $8^2$
$9^2$, $10^2$ which are odd are $1^1, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2$.
Therefore 
\[
|A \cap B| = 5
\]

Therefore
\[
|A \cup B|
= |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 50 + 10 - 5 = 55
\]
Hence the required number is 55.

\qed



\textsc{Note.} This is easy to check with a program:
\begin{console}
import math

def is_square(n):
    x = int(math.sqrt(n))
    # test x + 1 in case of rounding errors
    return x ** 2 == n or (x + 1) ** 2 == n

count = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 2 == 1 or is_square(i):
        count += 1

print count
\end{console}
The output is 55.

\textsc{Note.} Change the 100 to $N^2$ where $N$ is a positive integer.
Solve the problem.
Substitute 100 for $N$ in your solution and you should get 55.

\textsc{Question.}
Let $k > 0$ be an integer.
Why is the number of $k$--powers in $\{1, 2, 3, ..., N\}$
given $\floor{N^{1/k}}$?

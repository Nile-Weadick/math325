Let
\begin{align*}
U &= \text{set of all computer science students in the school } \\ 
C &= \{ x \in U \mid x \text{ took C}\} \\ 
L &= \{ x \in U \mid x \text{ took Linux}\} \\ 
J &= \{ x \in U \mid x \text{ took Java}\} \\ 
\end{align*}
We are given
\begin{align*}
|U| &= 2504 \\
|C| &= 345 \\
|L| &= 999 \\
|J| &= 1876 \\
|C \cap L| &= 231 \\
|J \cap L| &= 876 \\
|C \cap J| &= 290 \\
|C \cap J \cap L| &= 189 \\
\end{align*}
The required number is $|U - (C \cup J \cup L)|$.
By the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
\[
|C \cup J \cup L| 
= |C| + |J| + |L| - (|C \cap J| + |C \cap L| + |J \cap L|) 
+ |C \cap J \cap L| 
\] 
Therefore
\[
|C \cup J \cup L| 
= 345 + 999 + 1876 - (231 + 876 + 290) + 189 = 2012
\] 
Hence the required number is
\[ 
|U - (C \cup J \cup L)| 
= |U| - |C \cup J \cup L| = 2504 - 2012 = 492 
\]

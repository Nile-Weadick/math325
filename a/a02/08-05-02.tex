Let 
\begin{align*}
C &= \{\text{student who took calculus}\} \\
D &= \{\text{student who took discrete mathematics}\}
\end{align*}
We are given
\begin{align*}
|C| &= 345 \\
|D| &= 212 \\
|C \cap D| &= 188
\end{align*}
The required number is $|C \cup D|$.
By the principle of inclusion-exclusion,
\[
|C \cup D| = |C| + |D| - |C \cap D|
\]
Therefore
\[
|C \cup D| = 345 + 212 - 188 = 369.
\]
Hence the required number is 369.

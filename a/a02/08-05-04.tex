Let
\begin{align*}
P &= \text{set of owners that will buy a printer} \\
S &= \text{set of owners that will buy at least one software package} \\
\end{align*}
We are given
\begin{align*}
|P| &= 650000 \\
|S| &= 1250000 \\
|P \cup S| &= 1450000\\
\end{align*}
The required number is $|P \cap S|$.

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, 
\[
|P \cup S| = |P| + |S| - |P \cap S|
\]
Therefore
\[
1450000 = 650000 + 1250000 - |P \cap S|
\]
Hence
\[
|P \cap S| = 650000 + 1250000 - 1450000 = 450000  
\]
The required number is 450000.

Let $U$ be the apples in the bushel.
Define
\begin{align*}
P_w(x) &= (\text{there are worms in $x$}) \\
P_b(x) &= (\text{there are bruises on $x$})
\end{align*}
The required number is the number of apples that can be sold
which is the number of apples without worms and without bruises, 
i.e., the required number is $N(P_w' P_b')$.

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion
\[
N(P_w' P_b') = |U| - (N(P_w) + N(P_b)) + N(P_wP_b)
\]
We are given 
\begin{align*}
|U| &= 100 \\
N(P_w) &= 20 \\
N(P_b) &= 15 \\
N(P_w P_b) &= 10
\end{align*}
Therefore
\[
N(P_w' P_b') = 100 - (20 + 15) + 10 = 75
\]
Hence the number of apples that can be sold is 75.

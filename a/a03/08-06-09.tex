[HINT: Let the 6 toys be $T = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_6\}$ and 
the three children be $C = \{c_1, c_2, c_3\}$.
Each distribution is a function $f : T \rightarrow C$.
The fact that each child gets at least one toy is the same as saying
the function $f$ is onto.]

The total number of ways is the number of onto functions from a set
of 6 elements to a set of 3.
Let $T$ be a set of 6 elements and $C = \{c_1, c_2, c_3\}$.
let $U = \{f : T \rightarrow C\}$.
Define
\begin{align*}
P_1(f) &= (\text{the image of $f$ does not contain $c_1$})\\
P_2(f) &= (\text{the image of $f$ does not contain $c_2$})\\
P_3(f) &= (\text{the image of $f$ does not contain $c_3$})
\end{align*}
We have $|U| = 3^6$.

$N(P_1)$ is the number of function from $T$ to $C - \{c_1\} = \{c_2, c_3\}$.
Therefore $N(P_1) = 2^6$.
Likewise $N(P_2) = N(P_3) = 2^6$.

$N(P_1 P_2)$ 
is the number of function from $T$ to $C - \{c_1, c_2\} = \{c_3\}$.
Therefore $N(P_1 P_2) = 1^6$.
Likewise $N(P_1 P_3) = N(P_2 P_3) = 1^6$.

$N(P_1 P_2 P_3)$ is the number of functions from $T$ to $C - \{c_1, c_2, c_3\}
 = \emptyset$. There are no such functions.
Therefore $N(P_1 P_2 P_3) = 0$.

Therefore, by the inclusion-exclusion principle, 
the total number of ways is
\[
3^6
- \binom{3}{1} 2^6
+ \binom{3}{2} 1^6
= 729 - 192 + 3
= 540
\] 
The required number is 540.

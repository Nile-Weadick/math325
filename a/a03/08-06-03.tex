Let 
\[
U = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \N^3 \mid x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13 \}
\]
where $\N = \{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$.
Define
\begin{align*}
P_1(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 \geq 6) \\
P_2(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_2 \geq 6) \\
P_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_3 \geq 6) 
\end{align*}

The required number is the number of $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$
satisfying 
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13, \,\,\,\,\,
0 \leq x_1 < 6, \,\,\,\,\,
0 \leq x_2 < 6, \,\,\,\,\,
0 \leq x_3 < 6
\]
i.e., $N(P_1' P_2' P_3')$.
By the inclusion-exclusion principle, 
\begin{align*}
N(P_1' P_2' P_3')
&= |U| \\
&\hspace{0.5cm} - (N(P_1) + N(P_2) + N(P_3)) \\ 
&\hspace{0.5cm} + (N(P_1P_2) + N(P_1P_3) + N(P_2 P_3)) \\ 
&\hspace{0.5cm} - (N(P_1 P_2 P_3))
\end{align*}

We have
\[
|U| = \frac{(13 + 2)!}{13! 2!} = \binom{15}{2}
\]
(This is from Discrete I, i.e., it is the number of distribution
of 13 0's into 3 boxes, which is the same as the number of 
permutations of 13 0's and 2 1's).

$N(P_1)$ is the number of solutions to
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13, \,\,\, x_1 \geq 6, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
(x_1 - 6) + x_2 + x_3 = 13 - 6, \,\,\, x_1 - 7 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
x_1' + x_2 + x_3 = 7, \,\,\, x_1' \geq 0, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is $\frac{(7 + 2)!}{7! 2!} = \binom{9}{2}$.
By symmetry, clearly $N(P_2) = N(P_3) = \binom{9}{2}$.


$N(P_1P_2)$ is the number of solutions to
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13, \,\,\, x_1 \geq 6, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 6, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
(x_1 - 6) + (x_2 - 6) + x_3 = 13 - 6 - 6, \,\,\, x_1 - 6 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_2 - 6 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
x_1' + x_2' + x_3 = 1, \,\,\, x_1' \geq 0, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 0
\]
which is $\binom{1 + 2}{1! 2!} = \binom{3}{1}$.
By symmetry, clearly $N(P_1P_3) = N(P_2P_3) = \binom{3}{1}$.

$N(P_1 P_2 P_3)$ is the number of solutions to
\[
x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13, \,\,\, x_1 \geq 6, \,\,\, x_2 \geq 6, \,\,\, x_3 \geq 6
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
(x_1 - 6) + (x_2 - 6) + (x_3-6) = 13 - 6 - 6 - 6, \,\,\, x_1 - 6 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_2 - 6 \geq 0, \,\,\, x_3 - 6\geq 0
\]
which is the number of solutions to 
\[
x_1' + x_2' + x'_3 = -5, \,\,\, x_1' \geq 0, \,\,\, x'_2 \geq 0, \,\,\, x'_3 \geq 0
\]
which is clearly 0.


Therefore
\begin{align*}
N(P_1' P_2' P_3')
&= \binom{15}{2} - 3 \binom{9}{2}  + 3 \binom{3}{1} - 0 \\
&= \frac{15 \cdot 14}{2} - 3 \cdot \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} + 3 \cdot 3 - 0\\
&= 6
\end{align*}
The number of solutions is 6.

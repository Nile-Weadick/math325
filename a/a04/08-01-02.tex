Let $a_n$ be the number of permutations on $n$ distinct symbols.

The task $T$ of forming a permutation is
the same as the task $T_1$ of writing down the first symbol
following by the task $T_2$ of writing down $n - 1$ symbols distinct
from the symbol written down by task $T_1$.
By the multiplication principle,
the number of ways to perform $T$ is the number of ways to perform
$T_1$ multiplied by the number of ways to perform $T_2$, i.e.,
\[
a_n = n \cdot a_{n - 1}
\]

Clearly $a_1 = 1$.
To compute a closed form for $a_n$, note that
\begin{align*}
  a_n
  &= n a_{n - 1} \\
  &= n (n - 1) a_{n - 2} \\
  &= n (n - 2) a_{n - 3} \\
  &= ... \\
  &= n (n - 2)(n - 3)\cdots(n - (k - 1)) a_{n - k} \\
\end{align*}
When $n - k = 1$, we have $k = n - 1$ and 
\begin{align*}
  a_n
  &= n (n - 2)(n - 3)\cdots 2 \cdot a_1 \\
  &= n (n - 2)(n - 3)\cdots 2 \cdot 1 \\
\end{align*}

Hence
\[
a_n = n!
\]
for $n \geq 1$.

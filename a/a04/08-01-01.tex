Let $T_n$ be the number of moves to solve the $n$--disks tower of Hanoi
problem.
The recurrence relation is
\[
T_n = 2 T_{n-1} + 1 \tag{*}
\]
with base case of $T_1 = 1$.

Let $P(n)$ be the statement
\[
P(n) = \biggl( T_n = 2^n - 1 \biggr)
\]
for $n \geq 1$.
We will prove that $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 1$ using
induction.

\text{Base case.}
For $n = 1$, $T_1 = 1$
and $2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$.
Hence $T_1 = 2^1 - 1$. Therefore $P(1)$ holds.

\text{Inductive case.}
Suppose $P(n)$ holds, i.e., 
\[
T^n = 2^n - 1
\]
We want to show that $P(n + 1)$ holds as well, i.e., we want to show
\[
T^{n + 1} = 2^{n + 1} - 1
\]
From the recurrence relation $(*)$,
\[
T_{n + 1} = 2T_n + 1
\]
Therefore
\[
T_{n + 1} = 2(2^n - 1) + 1 = 2^{n + 1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1
\]
and hence $P(n + 1)$ holds.

Therefore by induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 1$, i.e.,
\[
T_n = 2^n - 1
\]
for all $n \geq 1$.
